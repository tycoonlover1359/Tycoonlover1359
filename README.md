### Hello there!
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm Tycoonlover1359, a young, aspiring web developer. As of this commit, I've been programming in Lua (albeit very lightly, so to speak) for about 4 years now when I made some of my first little ComputerCraft security toys for use in Modded Minecraft.

I quite familiar (dare I say, proficient? No, no I don't.) in Python, Java, and Lua. I am also moderately experienced with Amazon Web Services, particularly their serverless offerings (i.e., Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda, and Amazon S3, among some others). I have thought about providing my knowledge (however expansive or limited it is) of AWS services for payment, and I may be willing to do so, so just get in contact with me and we can work something out! (You could also just post on the `r/aws` subreddit, which I help out on somewhat frequently; if your post there entices me, you just might get some free help from me! I'm not an expert or anything, but I know my way around the cloud computing giant!)

If you'd like to view my portfolio of projects that I have publicly "announced," you can do so at https://github.com/tycoonlover1359/Portfolio.

If you'd like to get in contact with me, use the contact form available at my website: https://tycoonlover1359.omg.lol/. I'm also available on various social media networks; links to my accounts can be found at https://omg.lol/tycoonlover1359/. (Can you guess what my username basically everywhere is?)

At any rate, happy coding, and see you on the internet!
